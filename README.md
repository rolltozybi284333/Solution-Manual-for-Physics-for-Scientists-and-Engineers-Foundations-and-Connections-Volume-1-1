### Product Details:


* ISBN-10 ‏ : ‎ 0534466753
* * ISBN-13 ‏ : ‎ 978-0534466756
  * * Author:   Debora M. Katz
   
  * Master physics with Debora Katz's new, ground-breaking calculus-based physics program, PHYSICS FOR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS: FOUNDATIONS AND CONNECTIONS. Dr. Katz's one-of-a-kind case study approach enables you to connect math and physics concepts in a modern, interactive way. By leveraging physics education research (PER) best practices and her extensive classroom experience, Debora Katz addresses the areas where students like you struggle the most: linking physics to the real world, overcoming common preconceptions, and connecting the concept being taught with the mathematical steps to follow. How Dr. Katz deals with these challenges with case studies, student dialogues, and detailed two-column examples distinguishes this text from any other and will assist you in going beyond the quantitative to master your physics course.
